## Documentation

The package documentation is generated using [Documenter.jl](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/) package.
It is hosted at [github pages](https://marceljackiewicz.github.io/rrsp/).

The documentation goes through the API of RRSP solver in detail and explains types and solver functions.
However, for a quick start you can skip to [working example](https://marceljackiewicz.github.io/rrsp/#Working-Example) section.
